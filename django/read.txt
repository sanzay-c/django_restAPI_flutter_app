# --- from rest_framework.decorators import action
    action: This is a decorator from DRF that allows you 
    to add custom actions to a ViewSet. 
    These actions will be exposed as additional endpoints on the view set.

    -- query = request.GET.get('query', ''): This retrieves 
        the query parameter from the URL's query string.
        For example, if the client makes a GET request like 
        /recipes/search/?query=pasta, the query variable will be set to "pasta".
        If no query parameter is provided, it defaults to an empty string ('').
    
    --  @action(detail=False, methods=['get'])
        def search(self, request):

        'search' is the name of the method you defined.
        'detail=False' tells DRF that this action applies to the entire collection (i.e., all recipes).
        'methods=['get']' means it will respond to GET requests.
