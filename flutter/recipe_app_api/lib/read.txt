# --- Loading builder

The loadingBuilder takes three parameters:

1. BuildContext context: The build context, just like in the builder function of many Flutter widgets.
2. Widget child: The actual image widget that will be displayed once the image has finished loading.
    This child is passed to the loadingBuilder, 
    but you decide when to display it based on the loading progress.
3. ImageChunkEvent? loadingProgress: This contains the loading progress details 
    such as the number of bytes already loaded and the total number of bytes for the image. 
    It is null when the image is fully loaded.
